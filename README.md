# bubble 🫧

yo, straight up - this is where you dump your wildest shit without anyone judging. dreams, weird thoughts, that 3am imagination that hits different, whatever tf is in your head.

## what's this about?

ngl, sometimes you just need a space to yeet your thoughts into the void without filters, censorship, or people telling you "that's not appropriate" or whatever. bubble is that space.

- share your craziest dreams
- drop those random shower thoughts
- post opinions that might be too spicy elsewhere
- imagination dump without restrictions
- basically anything that's cooking in your brain

## features

- **no censorship** - say what you wanna say
- **anonymous vibes** - nobody's tracking your weird ass thoughts
- **clean interface** - simple af, no unnecessary bs
- **real-time updates** - see what other people are thinking rn

## tech stack

- JavaScript 
- CSS 
- HTML 

- Firebase for backend
  (realtime database and auth)

## setup

tbh it's pretty straightforward:

1. clone this repo
2. update `firebase.config.js` with your firebase creds
3. open `index.html` in browser
4. start sharing your unhinged thoughts

## why tho?

because sometimes the regular internet is too vanilla and you need a place where nobody's gonna cancel you for having weird dreams or controversial opinions. this ain't your linkedin post energy - this is raw, unfiltered brain dump territory.

## contributing

got ideas to make this better? pr's are welcome. just keep it real and don't add unnecessary corporate bs.
